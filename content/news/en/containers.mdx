<H2>I container per il trasporto merci</H2>

> A light (but useful) guide to understanding sizes, types, and when to use what.

## Introduction
The importance of containers, from international trade to our daily lives, is astounding: some **20 million** boxes make **over 200 million** trips each year, moving **nearly 90 percent** of the planet's goods. The idea, after all, is simple: **strong, standardized and relatively insulated metal boxes**.

Perhaps it is this mix of **simplicity and impact** that makes them fascinating: the stacks ordered into the port ready to leave, or the ships with hundreds of containers already routed to their destination.

In logistics, choosing **the right container** (and, when needed, the right medium) changes **cost, time and safety**. In this guide you will find the **main types**, **standard sizes** and **typical uses**, without unnecessary jargon.

## Containers: standards and main measurements

Before we begin, three useful things if **you are not in the industry**:

1. Containers are measured in **feet** (_1 ft = 30.48 cm_).
2. The measurements reported are **outside**; inside, the space is somewhat smaller.
3. ISO **standards** standardize measurements and codes worldwide.

## Types of containers (in brief)

- **Dry (STD)** - Closed, multipurpose. Perfect for general cargo on pallets or bulk.
- **High Cube (HC)** - Like the dry but **higher** (~+30 cm). Ideal for light and bulky volumes.
- **Open Top (OT)** - Tarped/opening roof. Loads **from above** with crane.
- **Flat Rack (FR)** - Without side walls. Machinery, packages **out of gauge**.
- **Platform** - Reinforced platform for exceptional/concentrated loads.
- **Reefer (RF)** - Refrigerated/isothermal. Cold chain (classes **ATP**).
- **Tank (TK)** - Liquids/foods/chemicals. Beware of **ADR/IMDG**.

### Examples of use

- **Dry/HC** → pallets, papermaking, textiles, electronics.  
- **Open Top** → coils, marbles, machinery loaded from above.  
- **Flat Rack/Platform** → excavators, shovels, long pipes.  
- **Reefer** → food and pharmaceuticals with controlled temperatures.  
- **Tank** → wines, oils, chemicals according to classifications.

## Typical problems and doubts

- **Volume vs. weight**: do you get over **m³** or **tonnes** first? It changes everything.  
- **Site access**: do you need **crane**, **top loading**, **banking** or side access?  
- **Commodity conditions**: temperature controlled, ADR, special packaging.  
- **Pathways/derogations**: underpasses, useful heights, ZTL, provincial, bridges.  

**FAQ flash**

- **Can I load 30 t in a 20'?** In theory yes, but **axles, road limits** and **balance** count. It has to be verified on a route-by-country basis.  
- **Does a 40' HC fit everywhere?** No: watch out for sheds/underpasses **< 2.9 m**.  
- **Better to be curved or vaned?** (when truck is needed) The **centered** is more flexible in loading; the **vaned** protects and seals better.

## Conclusion

When you have a **package list** (size/weight) or even just an idea of the cargo, you can start reasoning about which **transportation solution** is convenient, whether you need a particular set-up (**Open Top, Flat Rack, Reefer, Tank**) and what practical arrangements to consider (**brakes, reefer feeding, permits, dock appointments**).
